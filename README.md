# SF2565 Program Construction in C++, Project 3

In "task1.cpp" calculation of the sum of the first N terms in the Taylor series of the sine function as well as the cosine function was performed. Further the task aimed to compare the results with the sine and cosine functions included in the C standard library and show how the error is affected by the input value x and the number of terms from the sums.  
In "task2.cpp" the aim is to compute an approximation to a specific integral using prescribed tolerance and the adaptive Simpson's method for numerical integration.
